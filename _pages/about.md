I start a 2-year postdoctoral research position at Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn from September 2024.

In 2019.08-2024.06, I was a Ph.D student at Tsinghua University, under the guidance of Prof. Fan Xu.

My research is in algebraic and geometric Hall algebra, particulally in cluster algebras and Hall algebras.

My CV can be found here: [Fang Yang's CV](../assets/CV_FangYang.pdf).
